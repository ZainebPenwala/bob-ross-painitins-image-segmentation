## Problem Statement 

The assignment was solved using the following two approaches:

Approach 1: Using Detectron2's "Panoptic Segmentation" model to apply panoptic image segmentation on Bob Ross paintings

Approach 2: Using a trained semantic segmentation model using a custom training dataset containing Bob Ross paintings which was trained on top of a MaskRCNN prebuild network provided by Detectron2

The assignment contains two directories:
- pre-trained
- custom

The `pre-trained` directory contains the files of the solution that used Approach 1 specified above

The `custom` directory contains the files of the solution that used Approach 2 specified above
